Title: Stock Price Movement using Sentiment Analysis 
Definition: Stock analysis examines a particular trading instrument, an investing sector, or the whole market.
Objective: 
The main objective of using Sentiment Analysis to predict the stock market movement is to identify the general sentiment or mood of the market or a specific stock by analyzing the text data such as news articles, social media posts, and other forms of online communication. The sentiment expressed in these text sources can be used as a leading indicator of the stock market's future performance. The goal is to use the insights from the sentiment analysis to make more informed investment decisions by identifying patterns and trends in the sentiment data that may indicate future market movements.

The two methods used are the Bag of Words Model and TF - IDF vectorizer. 
The bag-of-words model represents text data as a numerical vector and the TF-IDF vectorizer is a technique to weigh the importance of words in a document. Both are used to convert text data into numerical data that can be used as input to machine learning models.

Expected Results: The goal is to achieve a high level of accuracy in predicting the direction of the stock market (up or down) based on the sentiment expressed in news articles, social media posts, and other forms of online communication. In this particular dataset, News headlines are considered.
